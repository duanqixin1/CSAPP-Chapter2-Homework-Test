# CSAPP-Chapter2-Homework-Test

Codes and methods used to identify codes' correctness in homework.

Testing codes are involved in 'float_absval()' in '0921.c'.

Tested codes are stored in both 'float_absval_official()' and 'test()' in '0921.c'.

Methods how I implement test process are described in 'methods.md'.

The homework which I wrote code for is Question 2.92, Page 177, CSAPP Third Edition.

Unfornately, the size of results is too big to store in my rented Linux instance. I have to give it up.

But until '40400000', everything was OK.
