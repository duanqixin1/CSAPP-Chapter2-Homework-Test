# CSAPP-Chapter2-Homework-Test

Codes and methods used to identify codes' correctness in homework.

Testing codes are involved in 'float_absval' in '0921.c'.

Tested codes are stored in both 'float_absval_official' and 'main' in '0921.c'.

Methods how I implement test process are described in 'methods.md'.

The homework which I wrote code for is Question 2.92, Page 177, CSAPP Third Edition.
