I rented a Alibaba cloud virtual machine instance costing $12 a month.

I assigned testing task into it instead of into my local machine considering insufficient hardware supports.

'gcc -o 0921 0921.c -std=c99', I get an 0921 file which is executable.

'./0921 > results.txt', I get an text file named 'results.txt'.

'cat results.txt | grep Error', there are no inputs, which means the code tested is passed and proved to be right.
